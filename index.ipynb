The book then informs us of automating test execution, in which expected results are stored in values and checked against the actual result, throwing an error if they do not match. The only limitation with this is that python's numeric types rarely are exactly equal up to a certain precision. To flush this problem, the book explains that a potential solution could use a pre-set margin of error to ensure the result is within its bounds, or to simply use `math.isclose()`, which apparently is the way of a true *pythonista*.\n",

        "In the chapter *What is Software Engineering?* of the [Software Engineering at Google Book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/pr01.html), the author outlines the importance of developing structured behavior to succeed in a software engineering environment. Firstly, many of the responsibilities in SWE are because of **long-term project management**. SWE principles are less important for a project that will be used for a shorter lifespan. Good practices can lead to a sustainable project, meaning that the project is able to react and adopt valuable changes during its life span.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technical debt and the cost of finesse are two things that negatively affect the health of a codebase. As said in this chapter: \"We’ve taken to saying, “It’s programming if 'clever' is a compliment, but it’s software engineering if 'clever' is an accusation.”\" 'Clever' work is seldom obvious and maintainable, which is why it harms a long lived system. If, for example, a side effect of some 'clever' code produced an unexpected behavior on the user-side, the user could begin to rely on that functionality *without realizing it was done unintentionally*. This idea is known as **Hyrum's Law**, which states that all observable behaviors in your tool will be relied on my some entity. A way to fight against technical debt is to implement scalability, which allows a codebase to be supported properly as it grows (i.e. the company grows with the code base). Weak points in scalability can be discovered by asking *\"Does my organization have a procedure in place to grow the amount of man power when the codebase or workload grows?\"* If the answer is no, then there is a high chance you have a scaling problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cost is a large factor in decision making, and this chapter briefly discusses its weight. There are various costs associated with decision making in SWE. Some of which are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Financial costs (e.g., money)\n",
        "* Resource costs (e.g., CPU time)\n",
        "* Personnel costs (e.g., engineering effort)\n",
        "* Transaction costs (e.g., what does it cost to take action?)\n",
        "* Opportunity costs (e.g., what does it cost to not take action?)\n",
        "* Societal costs (e.g., what impact will this choice have on society at large?)\n",
        "\n",
        "Being able to weight cost effectively is a tool used in leadership. Google's example of effective cost analysis is the ironic value of markers in a work place setting. Markers are cheap, but they are often found missing or dried up in meeting rooms. Google weighed the cost of constantly supplying markers to their employees against the flow of a meeting or brainstorming session being brought to a halt, and they decided it was better to yield a free flowing brainstorming session than to pay the price for regularly new markers. The decision has proven to do them well.\n",

        "In this chapter, we learn about black and white box testing. Black box testing allows us to test the *specified* behavior of a system, while white box testing focuses on revealing which part in the internal structure of the program went wrong during the testing process. Both have their beneifts, but generally white-box testing allows us to debug more easily. In assisting white-box testing, we can use `sys.settrace(f(frame, event, arg))` to trace the execution of the function. This provides us with the lines that are stepped through during program execution. These lines are then put into a set, which tells us the lines that have been covered *at least* once.\n",

        "We can also compare coverage between various test cases, which can provide a different aspect of code usage based on input. If you incorporate fuzzing into this, you could input every possible kind of data type in a function to test how the branches are covered statistically. If you discover a branch that never is covered for all iterations of fuzzing, then you have a serious issue!

The first principle to understand is that geniuses are never completely self made; every successful leader has had to work collaboratively at some point. The misconception that hard working individuals only get work done alone is a myth. It creates insecurity and sends narcissists on their own joy ride of self sufficiency (think about the connotations of \"10x developer\", for example).

        "I will save all of the class inheritance that follows in the fuzzing book; the usage of the `Mutator` is that it is inherited into a class that implements ways to actually *mutate* the AST. This may involve replacing meaningful statements with a `pass` statement before `return`, changing which mathematical infix operator is called, or short circuiting the execution of a function in some other way. Once all of the helper functions for performing mutation are written, we can implement ways to interpret this. It may involve looking at a file diff of the injected code or analyzing the AST. Thankfully, python allows you to convert AST expressions back into python code, so the author of this chapter opts to do so, using `difflib` to display the mutated changes.\n",

        "[This article](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch04.html) from the Software Engineering Book at Google challenges a lax mindset on striving for workplace inclusiveness. The majority of employees in the sector of SWE are males, usually White or Asian. We have witnessed numerous facial recognition models with a bias because of an imbalance of input data. This cannot be exclusively attributed to the lack of facial data representing all races and genders; we must consider the fact that *many people have been slow to pursue diversity, race and gender wise, in the field of technology*.\n",

        "A common question concerning attaining diversity in the workplace or in a set of users goes something like this: \"How can we seek to reverse [some large number of years] worth of inequity and exclusion?\" Many managers and leaders stagger at the thought of combatting the centuries of inequality between different races and genders. They fail to realize that *this is not their concern*. The responsibility of a manager in a company is to consider how they can create *their* environment such that it provides a place of inclusion. It may involve asking themselves questions to discover how their workplace may be implicitly favoring a certain demographic, or it may be seeking to understand where the needs of other demographics come into play and how those needs can be met. One important example is women in the workplace. Many managers are not keen on the idea of maternity leave, and often, managers are not familiar with handling such situations. Another example may be companies that have never dealt with drug abuse among their employees. Often, individuals struggling with substance abuse are immediately fired, but an inclusive workplace would seek to help them and, in some cases, seek to help them in the rehabilitation process to retain their employment. I recall a coworker who dealt with substance abuse. They disappeared off the face of the earth, likely because they didn't think their place at our company was redeemable after the mistakes they made. This sad situation is not specific to me, however. Many employers are faced with the same situation.\n",

Although no team leader can be perfect, they can keep these 'pillars' of managing in mind in order to try to provider their employees with the best experience possible.\n",

It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil.

This would allow us to better parse things like XPath expressions, YAML files, and many more things. We could really extend this to be everywhere in our test suite. Although we could spend all day writing more test cases, we will have to limit ourselves to implement only a few cases of this grammar-based fuzzing, however. I would like to see us use it for XPath expressions, if anything. I researched, and I was unable to find any examples of fuzzing that supplies syntactically-valid XPath expressions, so maybe this is our responsibility to create.\n",
