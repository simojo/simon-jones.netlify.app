#### Summary

In the preface of *Software Engineering at Google*, the section [Programming Over Time](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/pr01.html#programming_over_time) defines software engineering as "programming integrated over time." The purpose of the book is to answer reflective questions that Software Engineering (SE) teams should have during the lifecycle of a project and a company or institution. The thesis of the book is then laid out as motivated by three principles that should be held in the development process: **Time and Change**, **Scale and Growth**, and **Trade-offs and Costs**.
* **Time and Change** refers to how a codebase or stack adapts over the lifetime of a team or company.
* **Scale and Growth** refers to the need for an organization to adjust its practices and structure over the lifetime of a team or company.
* **Trade-offs and Costs** refers to how an organization analyzes historical data to make informed decisions from the previous two points.
